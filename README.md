# Pencil-Sketch-using-GAN
The "Pencil Sketch Generation using GAN" project aims to develop an advanced image-to-sketch conversion system using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The project is sponsored by Amritansh, with a focus on creating a user-friendly Flask-based website for sketch generation. The GAN model will be trained using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for machine learning datasets.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the power of GANs to generate realistic and high-quality pencil sketches from input images. GANs consist of two neural networks, namely the generator and the discriminator. The generator network learns to convert images into sketches, while the discriminator network evaluates the authenticity of the generated sketches.

The project will utilize the extensive dataset available on Kaggle, which contains a diverse collection of images and their corresponding sketches. This dataset will be used to train the GAN model, enabling it to learn the intricate details and characteristics of pencil sketches.

To enhance the accessibility and usability of the pencil sketch generation system, a Flask-based website will be developed. The website will provide a user-friendly interface for users to upload their images and obtain corresponding pencil sketches. It will also include features such as image preview, sketch customization options, and the ability to download the generated sketches.

The integration of Flask will allow seamless communication between the front-end and back-end of the website, facilitating efficient image processing and sketch generation. The website will be designed to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

Overall, the project, sponsored by Amritansh, aims to develop an advanced image-to-sketch conversion system. By leveraging GANs, Kaggle datasets, and Flask website integration, the project will provide users with an intuitive platform to generate realistic pencil sketches from their images.
